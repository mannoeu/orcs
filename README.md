# Ordinary Computer Simulator (OrCS)
**OrCS** is a cycle-accurate and trace-driven simulator developed to Computer Architecture researches. It simulates a simple architecture containing at least a processor, a main memory and a cache-hierarchy. It is being improved by the researchers every day.

## Credits
OrCS was developed in HiPES Lab (High Performance and Efficient Systems) in Federal University of Paraná:
* [Aline Santana Cordeiro](https://github.com/ascordeiro)
* [Marco Antonio Zanata Alves](https://github.com/mazalves/)
* [Ricardo Kohler](https://github.com/kohlerricardo)
* [Sairo Raoní dos Santos](https://github.com/sairosantos)

## Acknowledgments
OrCS is based on [SiNUCA](https://github.com/mazalves/sinuca) (Simulator of Non Uniform Caches) and was developed with the need of a simple and faster simulator which can be easily modified by the researchers.
